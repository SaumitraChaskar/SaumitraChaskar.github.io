Welcome to my blog! Here, I dive into the world of data engineering and system design, blending technical deep dives with the occasional excerpt from my adventures in the rabbit holes of Stack Overflow and GitHub issue discussions.

Often, I find myself tasked with something I've done before—somewhere deep in the archives of past projects. This blog serves as a collection of tutorials for my future self, designed to help me (and hopefully you!) solve these technical puzzles faster the next time around.

While the primary focus is on data engineering and system design, expect a wide variety of topics that touch on the things I’m learning, experimenting with, and refining as I work through real-world problems. Whether you’re here to troubleshoot, learn, or explore new ideas, I hope these posts provide the clarity and guidance you’re looking for.
