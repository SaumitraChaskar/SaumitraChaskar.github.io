<h1>Hi, I am Saumitra!</h1>
<p>A data centric software engineer with a keen interest in working on and delivering data driven applications.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing a <b>Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</b>, with a specialization in <i>data systems.</i></p>
<p> My professional journey began with an internship at <b>VMware</b>, where I worked on projects aimed at enhancing developer productivity, where I developed a keen interest in data engineering. I subsequently transitioned to the Enterprise Data Warehousing (EDW) team, where I was part of some key data engineering initiatives. Working on these high impact projects has given me <i>a deep understanding of the data engineering and data product management space and the ability to work with cross-functional teams to drive data-driven decisions.</i></p>
<p>Along with my current coursework, I serve as a Research Assistant at the <b>National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</b> in collaboration with the Beckman Institute, engaging in interdisciplinary research focused on simulation-aided medical prognosis, <i>this has allowed me to apply my data engineering skills to real-world problems.</i></p>
<p>Most recently, I interned at <b>Homesite Insurance</b>, where I contributed to modernizing a key rating tool and explored GCP cloud services to enhance the overall tool performance, scalability, and adoption. <i>I got the opportunity to explore the cloud data engineering landscape.</i></p>
<p>With these tools at my disposal, I am looking to further deepen my expertise in data engineering, enhancing my ability to work on high-impact projects that blend technical innovation with strategic data-driven decision-making. I am excited to continue applying my skills across interdisciplinary research, data product management, and cross-functional collaboration to create robust, scalable solutions that address real-world challenges.</p>
